    <td>This lesson I benefited from using my previous knowledge to help me with my quiz. I looked back at our artificial intelligence program to see how I asked the reader questions which had to be answered with letters. Once I had done this for my buzzfeed quiz I had an if command, elif commands, then an else command. I used a while loop around this and declared a variable before called answered which I would set to 0. They I would say while answered is not equal to 1 run the following code. I would then say answered = 1 in every instance where the question had been answered and then in the else command I would just put print ("Please Choose a valid option"). Also I used the strategy of copying and pasting parts of my code. I did this as it greatly sped up my work as when I copied the code for the quiz questions it saved lots of time as I only had to change a few things such as the input code and whether my 'total' (the variable in which I total up the scores from the questions to later use at the end) variable changed by a different amount.</td>

    <td>I definitely need to work on using brackets or parentheses. Firstly for if and print commands. When I write if and print commands I forget that I need the brackets and this wastes time so I need to learn to use them more. However, the place where I didn’t use brackets which hindered me the most was definitely during coding my questions. In this code i needed an input from the reader. I would then store this input in a variable, in this instance let us call it X. Then when I ask if the user had put a specific letter I wrote X.lower == “a”. Then the computer told me I had made a mistake however I was unsure of what I had done. When looking back at my artificial intelligence program I learnt that when using the .lower command I needed to use brackets like so: X.lower() == “a”. When I did this for some reason my program started working and the questions weren’t just repeated over and over again even if an appropriate letter is pressed.</td>

    <td>I have finished my buzzfeed quiz and embed the code at the bottom of this post. For my quiz, In the end I had to stop using my old logic, as I found faults in it, and began using new logic. I originally thought that I would have a variable for each superhero and I would add 1 whenever a question about that superhero was answered. However I Thought what would happen if two superheroes variables had the same amount. The logic I ended up using was that I would use a variable called total. In every question I would add a certain number corresponding with a certain superhero, then, at the end whatever range the number is in would be relating to a superhero and it would print what you are. I will improve my learning by remembering to use brackets more when writing code as it will save time.  </td>
