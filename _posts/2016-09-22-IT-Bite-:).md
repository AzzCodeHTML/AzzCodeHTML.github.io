Today we did more fuze programming, and yes, our computer was yet again in Chinese. We couldn't set up our computer as the VGA cable refused to work. We had to join a different pair. Soon later however our fuze box started working again so we could start programming some super cool  new programs. We got through lots of our instruction book! My favourite program was a conversation between two people. See you next week
