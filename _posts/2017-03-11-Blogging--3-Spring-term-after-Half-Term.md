    <td>To gain 5% of my python course during the lesson</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I benefitted from looking back at commands that I had forgotten such as how to make the reader input a number (input =  int(raw_input("What's 6 + 5? â€œ)). Also I made sure to not make any small syntax errors by constantly reminding myself where to put colons and what bracket to put. Finally when I didn't know how to do a command I asked a friend and if they knew they would remind me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I definitely need to work on not making small syntax errors as that wastes time. Also I should start reading the instructions of the level twice and noting in my head what commands I will be using for the code in the question.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come back to class having done 5 more percent of my python course. I will see what the next course is about and I will prepare myself so that I am ready to do it in the lesson.</td>
