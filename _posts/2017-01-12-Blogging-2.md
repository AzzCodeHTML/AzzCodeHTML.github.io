    <td>Firstly Mr Keen talked to us about not giving up and as we code we need to keep trying and learn from the mistakes we made. One of the learning strategies we used was watching a video about a Japanese boy that kept trying a vault. He kept on failing but eventually he succeeded and got over the vault. Also Mr Keen told us about hex. Another strategy we used was for Mr Keen to tell us about whatever we are doing (hex, for example) so that we can understand it better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As we discussed in the lesson I should try over and over again if there is something that I want to code and eventually I will be successful. Sometimes other people in the class ask silly questions (such as asking what are we doing if we had already talked about what we were doing) and that wastes lots of time.</td>
