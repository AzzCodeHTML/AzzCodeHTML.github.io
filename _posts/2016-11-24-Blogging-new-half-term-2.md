    <td>I learnt using help from my friends, that was very effective as I could get the right code so my blog will publish properly. Also I use the internet, I search up want I want to add ( this lesson a box shadow) then I put HTML and usually it comes up (I found out to get a box shadow the code you need to put in is box-shadow: then how many pixels I want it to be and a semicolon). Also this usually sends me to the same website, W3schools. I use this website a lot as it is very reliable and efficient. This lesson (as well as a little help from Mr Tansley and W3schools) I managed to add tables. First I needed a table{ } chunk of code, then I used table, th { } and table, td { } and added the details into them.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on remembering to put semicolons at the end of some of the lines of code because sometimes I forget and I have to redo that part and it wastes lots of time that I could be doing extra details. Also I should stop trying to write new code on my own or without help from the internet because the last time I did that I had to restart my whole blog. Instead of putting it in straight away I could use a website that allows me to mess around with the HTML and try new things out.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that now I have got into a flow a bit more so next lesson I can log in straight away and get working on my blog. Also I will decide what I want to add before the lesson so when I get in I can search up that straight away rather than taking a while, pondering about what to do during the lesson.</td>
