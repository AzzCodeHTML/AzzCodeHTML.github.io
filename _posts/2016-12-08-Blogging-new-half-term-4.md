    <td>Today in our lesson many people restarted their blogs as they didn't like them or there might have been some errors. I didn’t restart mine as I like it how it is and I have added quite a lot of custom code. Today after seeing Mr Tansley’s box shadows I asked him for help on how to make the shadow fade out. What he did was in the rgba(); blocks he put 0, 0, 0,0.4, then next he put 0, 0, 0, 0.3 (with the number of pixels at the start of the line and in between the two rgba commands, Mr Tansley also had a 0 at the start and end of the pixel commands). However when I tried this it didn’t work. I am not sure why, it could have been an error in the code. Also I managed to shorten my table command (table, th{}; and table, td{}; separately to table, th, td {}; as the code inside my th and td chunks were the same</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure the spacing of some of my code is correct so it works(for example box-shadow: not boxshadow: ) and doesn’t stop my blog from publishing. I need to make sure, if I am doing a background, that the image is the right size or I have to wait a long time for my blog to change. I shouldn’t be wasting time looking for avatars of backgrounds as I could spend that time adding new things to my blog. Also I should not assume certain commands or colours (such as light gray) work without testing them first</td>

    <td>Next time I will try and add a background colour to my tables. Also in my spare time at home I will try and find a nice background picture to do with IT (Mr Tansley’s recommendation) then I will add it to my blog(I don’t want to upload it during our lesson as it takes up lots of time). When I change my background I will probably have to change my colour scheme (I will do this during the lesson) of my tables and text. Whilst I do this I might also change the font and size of my text.</td>
