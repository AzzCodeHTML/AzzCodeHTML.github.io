    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To gain 5% of my python course during the lesson</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, the strategy that really helped me was looking back at something I didn't understand. I forgot about dictionaries and keys so I looked back at that section and saw that the dictionary was a group of keys in a curvy bracket and a key was something assigned to something else so when called such as in the for command it will return what the key is assigned to.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I have to work on not spending too much time on one question (as I did in the lesson), I should miss it out move on and come back to it later. Also I should remember what bracket is used for certain commands as I often forget such as using the square bracket for lists and the curvy bracket for dictionaries.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come back to class having done 5 more percent of my python course. Also I will look back on some of the courses I have already done to make sure that I understand all of the code. </td>
