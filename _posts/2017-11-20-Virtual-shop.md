    <td>This lesson I really benefitted on help from my friends. I needed their help as Mr Tansley was not here so he could not provide me with the information about what the class did last lesson. My friends explained to me the code that they learnt last lesson and what they did. I needed to add a discounting system, which I did, and then I did the extension which was to create a buy one get one free discount. Furthermore, I used the internet as a learning strategy. I was not sure how to round a number down so I searched it up on the internet. This was a good decision as I got what I was looking for immediately, the command that I was looking for was the =ROUNDOWN command. This proved very useful when I was working out how to code the buy one get one free deal.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that what limited my learning was not remembering some of the commands. For example, this week I forgot about the vlookup command and needed to look at my work to remember. The vlookup command was very useful for my virtual shop so I should try and remember it. Furthermore, I should try and neaten up my work and make it look better because at the moment it looks a bit messy. Also, once I Have completed the task at hand I should continue working and trying out new code and seeing what it does to my shop. This is what limited my learning and the habits that I need to improve on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will return to the lesson remembering the simple coding commands of google sheets such as the vlookup command, the left and right commands and the sum command. I will also make my work look neater so it looks more professional. Finally, I will complete extensions of future weeks and after I have done that I will try out new code and see what it does to my virtual shop and how it changes it. This is what I will change for next time and how I will improve my learning.</td>
