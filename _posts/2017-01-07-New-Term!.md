  <tr>
    <td>I used a few learning strategies this lesson. I applied my past knowledge as I already knew a bit about binary so that gave me a slight head start. Also I listened to what the teacher said as he told us many tricks that made it easier to get the number we needed from the binary. Also after my friends and I had done one of the questions we checked our answer with each other to make sure that we were right.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on not getting my binary numbers the wrong way round as I used to think that in 8 bit the binary columns went 1/2/4/8/16/32â€¦ but they actually go 128/64/32/16/8/4.... . Also I should work on doing the sums on paper as well just to check that I have got the right answer as I have a tendency to do sums in my head. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that next lesson I will bring a calculator as it will be quite hard to do some of the sums without it. Also I could note some of the things that I learnt in the lesson so that I remember them later on.</td>
