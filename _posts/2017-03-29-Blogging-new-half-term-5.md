(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>At home the main strategy I used for helping me was looking back at old code because sometimes I forget certain commands. This lesson I looked back at the lambda: and float commands as I didn't fully understand them. I learnt that a float is where there is an number with at least one decimal place (even .0) and that lambda x: x % 2 == 0 would be the same as def div_2(x): return x % 2 == 0.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to look back more often just to refresh my memory about all of the commands so that if a level with an old command needed comes up I know what to put. Also I should save and submit code more often so if I accidentally delete it I can just get it back.</td>

    <td>What will I do next time? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson hopefully I will be in school and at home I will do 5 extra percent so that I do not fall behind.</td>
