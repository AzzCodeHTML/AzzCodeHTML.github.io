  <tr>
    <td>This lesson, the strategy that really helped me was definitely syntax error messages. Without them it would take me ages for the latter levels on the different sections. This is because there is so much code and when you get an syntax error not only does it tell you what error it is it also tells you what line it is so you can look back at that line put a bracket or colon where you missed one and move on to the next level. Also another way that I avoid missing colons is when you press enter after doing a command finishing with a colon (if, for etc.)it will automatically indent the next line.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I definitely need to work on not making small syntax errors as that wastes time. Also I should start reading the instructions of the level twice as sometimes I misinterpret them and do something else completely.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come back to class having done 5 more percent of my python course. Also I will look back in the course about commands that I often forget such as the for command.</td>
