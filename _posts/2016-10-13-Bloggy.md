Today was full of fun fuse programming. We set up our machine easily and well, the first time EVER, and got programming. Today was really fun, we did a massive amount of code about a program which was about guessing a number from 1-100. We couldn't fully finish it so we have to do it next week. Byeeeeeeee, see you next week!
