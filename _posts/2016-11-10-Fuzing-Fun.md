Today we did more fuze programming but first we looked at our blogs. My blog is doing well however I can't upload one of my google docs and I don't know why. Today setting up the Fuze box worked very well as we were the first group to have our fuze box up and running! My favourite program that we did was something that changed constantly from a face to a space invader on space invaders. See ya next week.
