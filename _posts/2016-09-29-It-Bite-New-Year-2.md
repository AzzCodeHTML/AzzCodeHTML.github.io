Today we did more work with our fuze program. Luckily today we didn't have to set ours up as some of the machines were already in! However some of it was still in Chinese. We got through an abundance of work today. My favourite was an exercise with an apple. We ate 6 apples then when it was the last Apple it said there were none. Also the repeat programs are absolutely hilarious. See you next week. AzzCodeHTML Over and out! Byeeeeeeeee!
