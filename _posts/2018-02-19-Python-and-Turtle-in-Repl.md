    <td>This lesson we started looking at a new programming language called turtle. Turtle is based around a turtle (hence the name) which you can move around and create patterns using code. Mr Keen helped us to learn the simple commands in turtle such as forward() which moves the turtle a certain amount of pixels in whichever direction it is pointing in and right() and left() which make the turtle turn right or left a certain amount of degrees. Using this we managed to define a function that could draw a regular shape when given the amount of sides and how long you want them. Then we made this into a pattern using for and while loops. Afterwards, we were told to try and make more [patterns and try and make them change colour. I used the internet to help. Firstly I wanted my turtle to go quicker and I found out the command to use is turtle.speed() then the speed in the brackets. Then I needed to find out how to change the colour of the turtle and the lines it draws. I found out this was turtle.pencolor() with the colour in speech marks in the brackets. Finally I found out that you could change the thickness of the pen from one of my friends and the command to use was turtle.pensize() with the thickness of the pen in brackets.</td>

    <td>When using turtle, I need to work on spelling the commands right as I spent a lot or time figuring out why 'turtle.pencolour()' was wrong. It was wrong as turtle uses american spelling so it should have been ‘turtle.pencolor()’. I also need to work on making my code neater and compressing it where possible as sometimes I am unsure what some of my code means. I could also add some comments to my code to help me remember what I have done. I also need to work on when I declare variables as sometimes I declare them twice which wastes time. Finally, I need to remember to use colons after commands like while and for as I often forget this.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come back to the lesson with a bit more knowledge on the commands in turtle and how to use them effectively and efficiently. I will have experimented with the use of colour and will hopefully be able to manage to use colours other than black,grey and white as that is the point where I am currently at. I will also remember to use colons after my commands so I can get through more work in lessons and not waste time.</td>
