Today we had some major problems with our computer. We couldn't load up our fuze boxes.l Eventually when we loaded it up it just appeared as a green screen and when we got rid off that there were even more problems. After we fixed them we got coding. We finished our program that we had been working on today. Itâ€™s so so so so so cool! See you next week! Over and out!
