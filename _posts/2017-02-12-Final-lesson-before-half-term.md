    <td>This lesson the error messages from codecademy really helped me! Because they tell me what line the error is on it is usually a missing colon or letter so I can quickly fix it and then get back on track. Also I couldn't remember a command so I went back in the course to remind myself what it meant.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I NEED to stop making small errors on my code such as colons when defining functions and in if and elif commands. Also I should be sure to put capitals if needed and if not then remove them as I often do this in a string and it wastes time. Also read the instructions over again so I don't put the wrong command into the code and get confused.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will have done 10% more of my python course (not just 5 as we have half term). I will improve my learning by finding out the commands which I have forgotten the meanings to and when I do a chunk of code I will check it to make sure I donâ€™t make any silly mistakes.</td>
