Today was our first year 8 lesson! Our new teacher is Mr Tansley (last year was Mr Keen). Today we made our own computer in pairs. Firstly we put together the different parts (which were the keyboard, the mouse and the cables). We had to use the monitor from our computer as there weren't enough to supply the whole class.  Our computer was faulty and didn't work until we had pushed in the cables with all our strength, however it was in Chinese! We managed to work through and complete the first few exercises but we couldn't save them as we didnâ€™t have a USB. See you next week!
