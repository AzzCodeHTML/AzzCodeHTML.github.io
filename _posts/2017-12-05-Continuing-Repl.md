    <td>I learnt using many strategies. The first strategy was the. Help of my teacher Mr Keen, he reminded us of the while and for loop, what each one does and where to use it in our code. He also gave us worksheets which we used to help with the while and for commands. I really liked doing the pocket money one where we saw that if you start at 1 p a week if you double your money every week you will be a millionaire after 27 weeks. The while command means that while something is true another thing keeps happening. The for command means for iterations in a range of numbers it will do something that many times. This lesson the error messages were a massive help as they showed me where I went wrong and what went wrong so if I made a small mistake I wouldn't have to go through all my work checking for it, I can just get to the specified line and spot it instantly.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was forgetting to write parentheses. I always forget to write brackets when doing my print commands. I also forget doing brackets after writing my loops. I need to remember how the while command works as this lesson unfortunately I forgot how to implement the command in my code. Also I need to work on being case sensitive with my variables so they will work during code and I donâ€™t have to waste time changing it. Many times after while and for loops I also forgot to put in a colon so this wasted time which I could have been using to progress my skills.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> Next time I will come back looking upon the work that I did in the first lesson. also I am going to look on the while command so that I can use it in future lessons. Furthermore, I need to remember to check that my work has saved as sometimes when I return to my repl project what I most recently changed has not been there. Also I will keep using the error messages to guide me and show me what my common mistakes are.</td>
