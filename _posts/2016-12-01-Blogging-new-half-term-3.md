    <td>The most effective strategies were help from my friends and of course, the internet. Today as you know I had to find a container. Firstly I used W3schools and the internet to find out that the command was .container{ . Then I used my own knowledge and javascript tester (another really effective site where I can test out my code) to add the custom details. Then I tried to add a video. Firstly In added the hyperlink to index.html (I learnt this from a friend), then I tried to add that to other places but it didn't work. Next week I shall continue to pursue my goal of figuring out how to put a video into my blog. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure to spell everything right, as sometimes I don’t and I have to waste time on correcting it. Also even though I should submit my code in little bits sometimes I only change one word so I should plan my changes before I make them and do a few more at once to save time. Also I shouldn’t try things out only if I know that they will work and I will use them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As I have said next week I will continue to try and add a video to my blog. Also I want to change the border-shadow: of my tables so it looks good. I will use javascript tester for that. I will also try and change the font of my text. Finally I will test out different colours of the table{ and .container{ for the colours that match best.</td>
