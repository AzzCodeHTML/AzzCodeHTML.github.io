    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Today we looked away from repl.it python and into Run-Length Encoding which is compressing code</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand what run-length encoding is and what types of code compressions there are.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>This lesson I benefited from the task that we did in class. We both set up pixel pictures, encoded them then swapped with our partners to see if we could create their picture using the encoding. Me and my partner both successfully completed each others pictures. WE also benefited from the help of our teacher who told us how to calculate the amount of bytes saved. To do this you need to look at each row, get the number of different colours in order in that row and times by 2. For my picture, by compressing it I managed to save 74% of my original 400 pixels.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I definitely need to work on going with an idea and just doing it rather than spending time looking at it as this lesson I spent too much time thinking of a picture to draw. Also I need to learn to type quicker as I cannot touch type very well. This would help as it saves lots of time so I can progress and learn more during a lesson </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come back to the lesson having looked up lossy and lossless compressions as I did not get to it during the lesson. I will also practice my typing a bit to try and make it a bit quicker.</td>
