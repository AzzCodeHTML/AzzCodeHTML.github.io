    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Firstly we started not knowing anything about google sheets, in fact I had never even used google sheets before.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for the lessons?</td>
    <td>To learn a bit about google sheets and the commands that we used to help our Encoding project. Also to get to know a bit more about google sheets as it is very useful and could help me in later life.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I have successfully managed  to learn some commands  and create a simple coding, decoding, concatenating and splitting machine.</td>

    <td>In these lessons we have been coding, decoding, concatenating and splitting. The main way I learnt was from my teacher, Mr Tansley. He taught us how to use google sheets and the commands to use: 
V-lookup: this looks up one letter in one column of your google sheets then looks for another column and takes a letter from there which is on the same row as it, for example for ours, we had to vlookup the original message to the coded message and vice versa.
Right and left: takes a certain number of letters from the left or right of a message, we used this to separate the coded massage into the first letter, the first 2 letters, the first 3 letters and so on so you could then further separate them into the separate letters of the word to then decode.
Iferror: means that if there is an error the code will do something, for example we made it so that if there was an error the computer in  that box would say nothing</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that once I had finished the task, since I usually finished them early, I should have tried out new things rather that sitting there and doing nothing. I began to do this more in the later lessons as I was becoming more interested with the topic. I need to work on how I can extend the boxes of code so there is the same command along a line however I have some troubles with this as I have to separately change every one which is very boring and takes up lots of time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time when I come into the lesson I will have finished my concatenating and splitting mechanism of my google sheets. Also I will not spend any time sitting and doing nothing, I will work even after I have finished the current task Here is a code for you to work out: nhhoiyc.</td>
