    <td>This lesson I really benefitted on help from Mr Keen. We started the lesson when he showed us a simple Python 3 program which asked the user for their name then printed hello then their name. In this we saw the first essential building blocks of our code such as the print command which prints something to the screen, the input command which asks the user to input a string or a number, the if and elif commands which is where if something happens the computer is told to do another thing. Another thing is white space which is where you need to leave 4 spaces or 1 tab when indenting things. This may not sound like much however it is essential for your code to run smoothly. Finally there are variables which are the main building blocks of code. Mr Keen also demonstrated other commands as well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that what limited my learning was definitely whitespace. I am not used to pressing the tab button so instead I used the space bar 4 times however sometimes I hit it 5 or 3 times which halted my project and wasted time. Also I need to remember to use variables wherever and whenever I can as they are very useful as they can be changed (hence the name 'variable').</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will return to the lesson having completed 3 more of the input programs which will help me remember about the main commands of Repl and how to use them. Furthermore, I will continue to learn about the use of whitespace as I do my homework and I progress. Also I will try and get more used to using tab rather than the space bar. </td>
