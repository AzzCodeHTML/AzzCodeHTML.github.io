    <td>This lesson I benefited from using my knowledge from year eight about binary and denary. I already knew that binary was base 2 (meaning that only zeros and ones are used). I could also work out binary numbers to denary numbers but it would take some time. I also knew that denary is base 10 (which is what we use in everyday life). One of the tips for binary numbers was that if the last digit is a 1 the number must be odd. This is helpful as it means that we can do a quick check of our answers to see if we have made a mistake. Below we can see the numbers that the different digits of binary represent. For example 101110 would be 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 46. Also in all these different number types 10 is always the base. When converting denary numbers to binary numbers, a good strategy to use is take the power of 2 that is closest to the denary number then add or subtract until you get that number. For example let us say we need to convert 30 to binary. We can see that 32 is the closest power of 2 to 30 so 100000 must equal 32 so 11111 must be 31. Then all you have to do is take the one of to get 30. My Keen taught us that hexadecimal is in base 16 and since there are no digits bigger than 9 the digits go 0123456789ABCDEF where A - F is 10 - 16. 2 digit hexadecimal numbers can (like 8 digit binary numbers) go up to 255 as that is (16 * 15) + (1 * 15). Mr Keen showed us an easier way to convert hexadecimal numbers to binary and vice verse. We can see that the left nibble represents the amount of 16s in a number (so the tens column of a hexadecimal number) and the right nibble represents the amount of ones in a number (so the digits column of a hexadecimal number). This means that given a hexadecimal number, take the amount of 16s, let's say it is A (which is 10) for example, this means that the left nibble of the binary number would be 1010. Now let's take the second digit of the hexadecimal number. Let us say it is D (which is 13). This means that the right nibble of the binary number would be 1101. Therefore the hexadecimal number  AD is equal to the binary 10101101

    <td>I definitely need to work on checking my answers after I have done them, just doing small checks like making sure if its odd or even just to ensure that I have got the right answer. Also when it gets to longer decimal numbers, doing it in your head can be hard so you could draw out a table with the powers of 2 then put the binary number underneath it to make it easier to work out and keep track of where you are in the number. Furthermore, when using hexadecimal numbers I need to now get confused when it says things like 21 = 33, but I think as I do more sums like this I will get used to this.</td>

    <td>Next time I will come back to class having read up on some of my notes from the last lesson and giving myself some random hexadecimal, binary and denary numbers to convert to each other. Also I would like to look at hexadecimal a bit more as I am still a bit unsure about it as I did not know it before this week's lesson. Next week I think I will be ready for the test, I just need to check my answers after I have done them and use some of the tips that I learnt from this week's lesson.</td>
