    <td>This lesson we learnt lots from Mr Keen. Firstly we touched on adding binary numbers where you put both the numbers on top of each other (as you do in regular lng addition) then if you are adding a 0 + 0 then put 0, for 1 + 0 put a 1, then for 1 + 1 put 0 with a carry of 1 and finally if there are 2 ones and a carry of one being added it equals 1 with a carry of one.
-----
Then we looked at Binary Shift. This happens when you multiply or divide binary numbers. Multiplying by 2 shifts the number one space to the right, multiplying by for moves it 2 spaces, multiplying by 8 moves it 3 spaces and so on. When you divide binary numbers instead of shifting the numbers to the left you shift them to the right.
-----
When binary numbers do not equal whole numbers you need to use something called floating point.
-----
An 8 bit system can produce 256 things as the maximum number is 255 but we also have to count 0. We can also see this when doing index in python as it starts with 0. A 16 bit system can produce 2 to the power of 16 things, a 32 bit system can produce 2 to the power of 32 things and so on.
-----
The last thing we looked at was bits and Bytes. 8 bits = 1 Byte, 1024B = 1kB, 1024kB = 1mB, 1024mB = 1GB, 1024GB = 1TB. In an exam instead of 1024 this can be approximated to 1000.

    <td>I think I need to get quicker and more used with the methods of adding subtracting multiplying and dividing binary numbers. Also I need to work on getting quicker at converting binary numbers to denary numbers as I think that it takes me too long. Finally I need to remember about the computer science terms for certain things such as an 'overflow bit' and ‘binary shift’.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will have practised using binary numbers and will be more confident using them and doing operations with them. Also, I need to continue writing my computer science notes on my google document as they will be very helpful when writing up the blogs and more importantly useful when I need to start revising. Finally I need to remember the order of bits through to Terabytes as that is what will be needed for GCSEs</td>
