    <td>The main strategy we used to see the logic in these was actually doing the quizzes themselves. Doing this, I began to see how the logic worked in the questionnaires. Whenever you choose an answer something is stored such as a number, then at the end of your questions the numbers that you pick will determine the original quiz question. For example you could do favourite foods, then when a question is answered add or take away an number from a variable. Then after all of the questions you could say that if your variable is in a certain range your favourite food is x, if the variable is in another certain range your favourite food could be y and so on so forth. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on considering more questions to write for my program and in class making a decision over what I am going to do rather than thinking about it for too long and wasting time. Other than that I do not think anything else limited my learning as it was a good fun lesson and I was not confused or unsure about what we discussed.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will have planned the logic of the Buzzfeed quiz program. I will have a variable for each superhero. Then when a question is answered, the answer will correspond to a certain (or in one case multiple) superheroes. Then I will add 1 to each of these whenever one of the answers corresponds to it. After all of the questions I will see which superhero variable has the most then print that as the superhero that they are. This is how I will do the Buzzfeed questionnaire, also if I have time I will add some more questions whilst writing the code.
