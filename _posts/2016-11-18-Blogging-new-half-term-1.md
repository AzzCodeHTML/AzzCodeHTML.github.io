    <td>Today I learnt not only about fixing my blog but also some customisation of my blog. 

First I asked Mr Tansley how I should fix my blog. I noted down what he did to check there weren't any simple errors. Firstly he checked the email I had been sent from github, however it said 'page build failed with the following error: page build failed’. Next he checked my github settings to see if there was a reason for my site not to publish (as if you go to settings and the box is green, that means your blog is working fine, but if it is yellow, then your blog has errors). Mr Tansley thought that the failed page build was to do with the version of github I was using but he didn’t know how to fix that. This was a job for Mr Keen.

When Mr Keen came I told him about the problems that I was having. He started checking what could have gone wrong. I remembered what he did. Firstly he checked the .md files were all in place and there were the right amount of them. Secondly he checked if I had committed any of the blogs to my website as well as my posts. I had committed one to the website as well, but after we got rid of that there were still errors. Finally he checked what version of github I was in. It was meant to be kramdown but that wasn’t what I had put in there. After he changed it my page still didn’t build.

Finally we had to resort to just deleting my repository and starting again, so yes, we fixed my blog by making a new one.

The most effective strategy I learnt from this was definitely watching what the teachers did to try to fix my blog and remembering them so in the future I can fix my blog on my own.</td>

    <td>I need to work on not asking the teacher so much and trying things out for myself. If after trying lots of techniques that don’t work I should just delete the repository myself so I can get to work making my new blog ASAP. 

Also the fact that I didn’t change the version and that it didn’t tell me what I was doing wrong limited my learning. I need to stop asking teachers for help, and maybe ask my fellow classmates first.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will listen more to any extra code to make sure that I don’t make any silly mistakes ( such as missing a semicolon or typing a bracket the wrong way round ). Also I will make sure in the future to only make small changes at once so if it is wrong I can go back and change it or get rid of it.

I can improve my learning by using other resources from online to help my code. I have found a website called W3schools that shows me lots of cool different code. Also I can search what I want up on the internet to see how to do it.</td>
