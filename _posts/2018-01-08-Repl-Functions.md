    <td>A function is used to divide your code into parts and it allows you to reuse certain parts of it by calling a function several times. This lesson I benefited from my previous knowledge of python from the last course I did as I already knew how to define one: def(). You can put a local variable in the brackets such as amount and then when you call the function you can choose an amount to put in. I also learned from the worksheets that we completed in the lesson. I forgot how to acquire a random number from a list of numbers. For this you need to import random at the beginning of your code: random.randint(a, b). You can then define this as a variable and print it to give a random number between a and b.</td>

    <td>I need to work on trying different approaches to my programming. I need to use more functions to make my work neater and ensure I can reuse parts of code. At one point this lesson, I had come across a problem with if, elif and else code. I was trying to let the reader of the code input a number however if they chose a number that did not correlate to anything then my code would be full of endless lines of "Please choose a valid option". For some reason it stopped doing this when I used more elif and else blocks. Also I need to remember which lines of code need colons after them and which lines of code dont. Also I sometimes forget that when you print strings or integers you need to put them in brackets. Also, I had a bit of trouble with variables. I need to remember that when you define a variable for the first time there is only one equals sign.</td>

    <td>Next time I will return to the lesson having completed the rest of my card picker project. I will also try and find a neater way to lay out my code as sometimes I do not know where I put a specific line of code and will have to look through, wasting time. I should keep on trying new lines of code to challenge myself and to fully understand what we learn in class.</td>
