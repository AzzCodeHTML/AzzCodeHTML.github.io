    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Before the lesson I was at 66% on my python course.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To gain 5% of my python course during the lesson</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No because in the lesson we mostly talked about how to get videos on our blogs and Sexism</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I benefitted from the hints given in questions. This is because it sometimes gives the the command I need so that I don't have to look back at earlier levels to find it (such as how to find if a number is divisible by another). Also I need to pay more attention to the information tab in the top left of the screen as there it explains the commands. My friends also helped me this lesson. Also another effective strategy was the teacher telling us as he told us how to add videos to our blog or separate posts if we wanted to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to save and submit my code more often to see whe my errors are and how the current code is working, not to do large chunks of code then check that it works at the end. Also I should ask about code that I think is right but is wrong as that will help me understand my mistakes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will come back to class having done 5 more percent of my python course. I will also look at the next course to see what code there is so that I can look back at some parts.</td>
